# Tasks2Todo.txt

This is a simple utility to convert [Tasks](https://tasks.org) backup files to the [Todo.txt file format](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt).

## Usage

Two command-line parameters are accepted:

- the input file: a backup file from Tasks in JSON format
- (optionally) the output file (a text file in Todo.txt format). If the output file is omitted the output is sent to the standard output (the console, unless redirected).
